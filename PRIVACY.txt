The Mini4WD Chrono app doesn't collect or store your personal data.

If you enable the Google Spreadsheet function, a "mini4wdchrono" folder will
be created in your Google Sheets account, and spreadsheet files will be
created inside that folder, containing race data. The spreadsheets will not
be shared or stored in other places, just your account.
